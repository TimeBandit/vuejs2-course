# Conditionals & Rendering Lists

## Conditional Rendering

### v-if

In vue you can conditionally render markup using the `v-if` attribute.

```html
<h1 v-if="flag">title</h1>
<h2 v-else>another title</h2>
```

where flag is a property of data or a computed property. To work `v-else` must always come after a `v-if` of `v-else-if` statement.

When rendering conditional element vue will try to reuse what it can. This can include common tags between the blocks. This can be a good thing for example let's say they share have an input element in common. Vue will resue the element and only update what is different. For example:

```html
<template v-if="loginType === 'username'">
 <label>Username</label> <input placeholder="Enter your username" />
</template>
<template v-else>
 <label>Email</label> <input placeholder="Enter your email address" />
</template>
```

In this example Vue will not replace one input element with the other. It will use the same one but only change the placeholder value. This has the effect of keeping whatever the user typed in between the two block being rendered.

If you want them to be completley unrelated and new; use a key attribute.

```html
<h1 key="title">title</h1>
```

### v-show

This directive is similar to `v-if` but unlike it, it does not remove the element from the div. instead it toggles the css display property.

In addition `v-if` will not render anything if the flag is `false` at runtime. Whereas `v-show` will always render a block at runtime. So `v-if` is costlier since it's changes the structure of the dom; doing this frequently is not a good thing. Use `v-if` if you expect it not to change
